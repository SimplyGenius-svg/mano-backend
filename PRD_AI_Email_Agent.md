# Product Requirements Document: AI-Enhanced Email Processing Agent (Mano 2.0)

## 1. Introduction

*   **Project Name:** AI-Enhanced Email Processing Agent (Mano 2.0)
*   **Overview:** This project aims to upgrade the existing `agent.py` email processing system (internally referred to as "Mano") by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. The goal is to enhance its ability to intelligently understand, categorize, manage, and assist in responding to emails, thereby improving operational efficiency, response quality, and the overall effectiveness of communication management.
*   **Problem Statement:** The current `agent.py` relies on rule-based logic (sender domains, keywords) for email classification and processing. While functional, this approach can be:
    *   **Brittle:** Rules may not cover all scenarios and can break with slight variations in email content or sender patterns.
    *   **High Maintenance:** Adding new rules or modifying existing ones for evolving communication patterns can be cumbersome.
    *   **Lacking Nuance:** It struggles with understanding the true intent, sentiment, or urgency within an email, leading to potentially suboptimal prioritization or responses.
    *   **Limited Scalability:** As the volume and complexity of emails grow, a purely rule-based system becomes increasingly difficult to manage effectively.
*   **Proposed Solution:** To leverage AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic frameworks like Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), to introduce intelligent capabilities into the email processing pipeline.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goals:**
    *   Significantly improve the accuracy and granularity of email classification.
    *   Automate or substantially assist in drafting contextually relevant and personalized email responses.
    *   Reduce the manual effort and time required for email processing and management.
    *   Enhance the system's ability to understand and act upon nuanced information within emails (e.g., intent, key entities, urgency).
*   **Secondary Objectives:**
    *   Explore and potentially implement Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) to structure and streamline the development of AI agent functionalities.
    *   Provide better summarization of lengthy emails or threads for quick understanding.
    *   Enable more sophisticated task prioritization based on AI-driven insights.
    *   Lay the foundation for future AI-driven communication automation features.

## 3. Target Users

*   **Primary Users:** The internal team/operator(s) responsible for managing communications handled by `agent.py` (e.g., interactions with founders, partners). This AI enhancement aims to make their workflow more efficient and effective.
*   **Secondary Beneficiaries:** Founders, partners, and other correspondents who will benefit from more timely, accurate, and contextually appropriate communications.

## 4. Proposed Solution & Features

The solution involves augmenting the existing `agent.py` with a suite of AI-powered agents.

*   **F1: AI-Powered Email Classification & Understanding Agent**
    *   **Description:** An AI agent responsible for deep analysis of incoming emails.
    *   **Capabilities:**
        *   Utilize an LLM to classify emails into more granular categories than the current "founder," "partner," or "other" (e.g., "New Pitch," "Follow-up Question," "Meeting Request," "Urgent Issue," "Feedback," "Spam/Irrelevant").
        *   Perform Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to extract key entities (e.g., company name, contact person, project name, funding stage, key dates, action items).
        *   Identify email sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, urgent).
        *   Determine primary intent of the email.
    *   **Integration:** This agent's output will augment or replace the logic in `is_founder_email`, `is_partner_email`, and provide richer data to the `process_email` function.

*   **F2: AI-Assisted Response Generation Agent**
    *   **Description:** An AI agent that helps draft or fully automate email replies.
    *   **Capabilities:**
        *   Based on the classification, entities, and intent from F1, generate contextually relevant draft responses.
        *   Personalize drafts using extracted entities and historical communication context (if available).
        *   Offer multiple response suggestions where appropriate.
        *   For well-defined, low-risk scenarios (e.g., simple acknowledgments, FAQ answers), potentially send automated responses after meeting a confidence threshold.
        *   Leverage existing Python functions (e.g., `handle_founder_email`, `handle_founder_reply`) as "tools" or knowledge sources for generating responses.
    *   **Workflow:** Human-in-the-loop for review and approval of most AI-generated drafts initially, with a gradual increase in automation for trusted scenarios.

*   **F3: Email Summarization Agent**
    *   **Description:** An AI agent to provide concise summaries of email content.
    *   **Capabilities:**
        *   Generate brief summaries of long individual emails.
        *   Summarize entire email threads to quickly catch up on conversation history.
    *   **Integration:** Summaries can be stored in Firebase alongside email data and displayed in a management UI or included in notifications.

*   **F4: Intelligent Task Prioritization & Routing Agent (Orchestrator)**
    *   **Description:** A higher-level AI agent that uses insights from other agents to manage the email workflow.
    *   **Capabilities:**
        *   Prioritize emails based on urgency (derived from sentiment/keywords), sender importance, or identified deadlines.
        *   Route emails to specific internal workflows or flag them for immediate human attention.
        *   Potentially create tasks in an external system or a dedicated Firebase collection (e.g., "Schedule follow-up for [Pitch]").
    *   **Integration:** This agent could become the central decision-maker in the `run_agent` loop, orchestrating calls to other specialized agents.

*   **F5: Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) Integration (Exploratory)**
    *   **Description:** Investigate and potentially adopt Google ADK as the framework for building and orchestrating the AI agents described above.
    *   **Benefits:** ADK's model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic nature, along with its tools for workflow definition (sequential, parallel, loop, LLM-driven routing) and multi-agent architecture, could provide a robust and scalable foundation.
    *   **Implementation:** Define existing Python functions (e.g., `connect_to_email_server`, `fetch_new_emails`, Firebase CRUD operations) as "tools" that ADK agents can utilize.

*   **Technical Stack Considerations:**
    *   **Programming Language:** Python (existing)
    *   **Database:** Firebase (existing)
    *   **AI Models:** Selected LLM(s) (e.g., Claude Anthropic, OpenAI GPT series, or other suitable models).
    *   **Agent Framework:** Google ADK (to be evaluated and potentially adopted) or research Langflow and N8N usage. 
    *   **Libraries:** `google-adk`, LLM client libraries, existing libraries in `agent.py`.

## 7. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

*   **R1: AI Misclassification or Inappropriate Responses:**
    *   **Risk:** AI agents may misunderstand context, leading to incorrect email categorization or generation of unsuitable/offensive responses.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement a strong human-in-the-loop (HITL) review process, especially in early stages.
        *   Develop comprehensive test suites with diverse email scenarios.
        *   Use confidence scores from the LLM to flag low-confidence outputs for mandatory human review.
        *   Gradual rollout of automated responses, starting with very specific, low-risk scenarios.
        *   Regularly audit AI performance and retrain/fine-tune models as needed.
*   **R2: Complexity of Integrating ADK or other AI Frameworks:**
    *   **Risk:** Integrating a new framework like ADK might introduce unexpected technical challenges or a steep learning curve.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Conduct a dedicated technical spike/Proof of Concept (PoC) for ADK integration on a small scale.
        *   Allocate sufficient time for learning and experimentation.
        *   Ensure team members have or acquire necessary skills.
*   **R3: LLM API Costs and Performance:**
    *   **Risk:** High API call volume could lead to significant operational costs. API latency could slow down email processing.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Optimize prompts and batch API calls where possible.
        *   Explore different LLM model tiers to balance cost and performance.
        *   Implement caching for repetitive queries or common information.
        *   Set up budget alerts and monitor API usage closely.
*   **R4: Data Privacy and Security:**
    *   **Risk:** Processing sensitive email content through third-party LLMs raises privacy concerns.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Choose LLM providers with strong data security and privacy policies (e.g., options for data non-retention).
        *   Anonymize or pseudonymize data before sending to LLMs where feasible.
        *   Implement strict access controls for email data and AI agent configurations.
        *   Comply with all relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **R5: Scalability Issues:**
    *   **Risk:** The system might not scale effectively with a large volume of emails or complex AI processing.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Design agents for asynchronous processing.
        *   Optimize database queries and interactions.
        *   Leverage scalable cloud infrastructure for deploying agents if needed.
        *   Load testing to identify bottlenecks.

## 8. Future Considerations / Out of Scope (for V1)

The following are considered for future iterations but are out of scope for the initial Mano 2.0 release:

*   **Full End-to-End Automation:** Complete automation of responses for a wide range of complex email types without human review.
*   **Proactive Communication:** AI agents initiating outbound communications based on learned patterns or triggers (beyond direct replies).
*   **Multi-Channel Integration:** Extending AI agent capabilities to other communication channels (e.g., Slack, social media DMs).
*   **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard for visualizing email trends, AI performance, and communication patterns.
*   **Deep Integration with CRM/Other Business Systems:** Beyond basic data lookup or task creation.
*   **Self-Learning from All Interactions:** Continuous, unsupervised learning from every email and response without periodic retraining cycles (this requires very advanced MLOps).

This PRD provides a foundational plan. It should be considered a living document, subject to refinement as the project progresses and new insights are gained.
